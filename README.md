# MazeGame

## Description
A simple maze game that allows the player to solve mazes of various sizes. Mazes are randomly generated, and a player's score increases when they move along the path towards the finish, and goes down when they make a wrong turn.

## Features I'm Most Proud Of
* Utilized Prim's algorithm for maze generation
* Implemented breadth-first-search to maintain shortest path to finish
* Maintain history of player movement and a player score
* First project with Monogame framework

## Build Instructions
1. Download Visual Studio
2. Launch the `.sln` file found in the root directory
